with open('texts.csv', 'r') as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    for x in f:
        print (x)
why does this work ?

    How does the rows become lists, like where did we define them as lists ?

    for row in calls:
        print (row[0])   

    How does the rows become lists, like where did we define them as lists ?


    with open('calls.csv', 'r') as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    calls = list(reader)
    mylist = []
    i = 0 
    for row in calls:
        mylist[i] = row[0]
        i += 1
        mylist[i] = row[1]
        i += 1

    print (mylist)
    print ("test")



when i print the elements of list, I cant see first element printed

in list are the items stored with index value, one after the other, I beleieve so 

shouldnt i use dict.keys when converting to list, like why does this method work ?



 for x in mydict:
        print (x)
        print (mydict[x])

how can we use the same x
check if value exists in dictionary ?

elif only run if the if statement is false

can you run a function inside print function ?


for the with open function, can you write code after it as you have stored lists
