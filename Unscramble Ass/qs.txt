why does this work ? resolved

    How does the rows become lists, like where did we define them as lists ? resolved

    with open('calls.csv', 'r') as f:
        reader = csv.reader(f)
        calls = list(reader)
        mylist = []
        i = 0 
        for row in calls:
            mylist[i] = row[0]
            i += 1
            mylist[i] = row[1]
            i += 1


    you can only index the values that are already in the list, otherwise use append

    print (mylist)
    print ("test")

resolved

when i print the elements of list, I cant see first element printed --> memory limit, resolved

in list are the items stored with index value, one after the other, I beleieve so 

shouldnt i use dict.keys when converting to list, like why does this method work ?



 for x in mydict:
        print (x)
        print (mydict[x])

how can we use the same x
check if value exists in dictionary ?

elif only run if the if statement is false

can you run a function inside print function ?


for the with open function, can you write code after it as you have stored lists
